#(text-style:"fidget")[The Hospital]

I’m guessing it was around 8 am when I woke up, at first I didn’t even bother to open my eyes, I just blindly tried to find my phone that was laying on my bedside table by stupidly waving my hand around the place where it should be standing until I would eventually bump into it.
It took me too long to find it so I opened my eyes, as I got blinded by the bright harsh light, my vision went blurry and I became lightheaded.
Once my eyes had gotten somewhat used to the harsh light I immediately realized that this was not my room just by seeing the ceiling.
In my room the ceiling was very different, it was a lot closer to my bed, it was a light shade of grey and had red handprints painted on it, I did those myself to give my room a creepy vibe. But this ceiling was different, it was a lot further from for my bed, it was a way lighter shade and didn’t have any handprints on there.
it scared the shit out of me and I quickly jumped out to look at the rest of the room.
When I looked around the room it was instantly clear that I was in a hospital.
There were 5 hospital beds with the blankets thrown all over the place, the pillows were still laying in the same place though. The room had an old television that was covered with cobwebs and dust, it had a crack from the upper left corner all the way to the centre of the screen and it was hanging on the wall to my right. There were also a lot of old posters about healthcare hanging half off the wall. 
It was way too quiet and messy for it to be a hospital, but yet it was one.
As I looked down I noticed that I was wearing a hospital gown and that I didn’t have shoes or even socks on.
I was very confused, I had so many questions.
‘Why am I in a hospital?’
‘Why isn’t there anyone here except me?’
‘How long have I been here?’
‘Am I dead?’
‘where is my family?’
