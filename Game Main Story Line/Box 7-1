Confused I slowly walked towards the wide open door.
I peeked around the corner and saw a couple of silhouettes sitting lifelessly on all fours in the dark hallway which was filled with hospital beds and equipment that was scattered all over the place, it had two doors with a flickering green exit sign above at the end.
These silhouettes, they were almost humanlike but not entirely, they had weird bubbles around their body, their skin almost looked transparent and they made weird echolocation-like clicking noises.
I was terrified.

[[I think i should try to create contact. Maybe a "hello"]]

[[**Shudder** To creepy i should try to sneak around get out]]
